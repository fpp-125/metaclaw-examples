# metaclaw-examples

Community and starter examples for MetaClaw.

## Included

- `examples/obsidian-bot/`: Obsidian + LLM starter agent generated by `metaclaw wizard`.

## Quick Start

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...
metaclaw run examples/obsidian-bot/agent.claw --llm-api-key-env=GEMINI_API_KEY
```

Notes:
- API keys are injected at runtime and are not stored in `agent.claw`.
- `vault/`, `config/`, and `logs/` folders are project-local mounts for the container habitat.
